# NetflixGPT: About the project
The NetflixGPT WebApp is an AI-driven platform that enhances the Netflix experience. It is designed to enhance your movie-watching experience by intelligently recommending movies based on your preferences. Upon signing in or signing up with your credentials, users are directed to the main dashboard where they can explore a curated list of movies. The dashboard features autoplay movie trailers fetched from YouTube embeds for an immersive preview experience. Leveraging the power of the TMDB API, NetflixGPT provides access to a wide range of movie categories including trending movies, top-rated movies, and upcoming releases, ensuring a constantly updated selection.

The standout feature of NetflixGPT is its integration of artificial intelligence through GPT search functionality. Powered by the Google Gemini API, users can enter queries such as "Suggest me some Indian horror movies," and NetflixGPT intelligently combines results from both TMDB and Gemini APIs to provide personalized movie recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.
